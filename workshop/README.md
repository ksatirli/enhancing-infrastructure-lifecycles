## Usage

To take part in this workshop, you will need to sequentially edit a handful of files in this directory.

Workshop steps are indicated with a (commented) _wrench_ emoji: `üîß`, followed by an instruction:

```hcl
# üîß WORKSHOP: set the Terraform version here
```

### Flow

This section contains the suggested flow for this workshop.

#### Initialize Terraform

* open `terraform.tf` and complete `4` steps
* run `terraform init` in your terminal
* verify your code and run `terraform providers`
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Providers required by configuration:
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ provider[registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm] 2.82.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ provider[registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local] 2.1.0
```

#### Configure the AzureRM Provider

* open `providers.tf` and complete `5` steps
* run `terraform plan` in your terminal
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

#### Create the Resource Group

* open `resource_groups.tf` and complete `4` steps
* open `variables.tf` and complete `2` steps
* run `terraform fmt` in your terminal to format the code
* run `terraform validate` in your terminal to validate the code
* run `terraform apply` in your terminal to apply your changes

#### Create the Network Configuration

* open `network.tf` and complete `6` steps
* open `network_publicip.tf` and complete `6` steps
* open `network_interface.tf` and complete `10` steps
* open `network_subnet.tf` and complete `6` steps
* run `terraform fmt` in your terminal to format the code
* run `terraform validate` in your terminal to validate the code
* run `terraform apply` in your terminal to apply your changes
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

<small>The `4` in the above output refers to the Virtual Network, Subnet, Network Interface, and the Static IP you just created.</small>

#### Create the Virtual Machine

* open `virtual_machine.tf` and complete `17` steps
* run `terraform fmt` in your terminal to format the code
* run `terraform validate` in your terminal to validate the code
* run `terraform apply` in your terminal to apply your changes
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

<small>The `1` in the above output refers to the Windows Virtual Machine you just created.</small>

#### Create Output Values

* open `outputs.tf` and complete `3` steps
* run `terraform apply` in your terminal to apply your changes
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

virtual_machine_public_ip_address = "<Virtual Machine IP Address>"
```

<small>Outputs are not counted as resources in Terraform.</small>

#### Create Remote Desktop Configuration

* open `remote_desktop_connection.tf` and complete `6` steps
* run `terraform apply` in your terminal to apply your changes
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

virtual_machine_public_ip_address = "40.121.23.96"
```

<small>The `1` in the above output refers to the RDP Configuration file you just created.</small>

#### Connect to the Virtual Machine (optional)

* open `converge.rdp` using Microsoft Remote Desktop ([Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps#activetab=pivot:overviewtab), [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12))
* enter the password you previously set
* click the "Connect" button
* install and play Minesweeper üí£

#### Remove resources

‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing with this step will remove _all_ Terraform-managed resources created in the previous steps.

* run `terraform destroy` in your terminal to destroy all resources
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 6 to destroy.
```

* confirm the destruction by typing `yes`

## Notes

* Many parts of this workshop align with current Terraform best-practices. The resulting resources, however, must _not_ be considered production-grade.
