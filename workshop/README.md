### Flow

#### Initialize Terraform

* open `terraform.tf` and complete `5` steps
* run `terraform init` in your terminal
* verify your code and run `terraform providers`
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Providers required by configuration:
.
â”œâ”€â”€ provider[registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random] 3.1.0
â”œâ”€â”€ provider[registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm] 2.82.0
â””â”€â”€ provider[registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local] 2.1.0
```

#### Configure the AzureRM Provider

* open `providers.tf` and complete `5` steps
* run `terraform plan` in your terminal
* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

#### Create the Resource Group

* open `resource_groups.tf` and complete `4` steps
* open `variables.tf` and complete `2` steps
* run `terraform fmt` in your terminal to format the code

* compare the output with the following output:

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

<small>The `3` in the above output refers to the Virtual Network, Subnet, and Network Interface you just created.</small>

#### Create the Virtual Machine

* open `virtual_machine.tf` and complete `` steps
* run `terraform fmt` in your terminal to format the code
